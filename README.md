## 🧩 Academic Overview

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at **Howard University**, specializing in **Energy, Urban, and Environmental Economics**.  
My dissertation, *"Climate Change, Energy Demand, and Policy Impacts: Analyzing Residential and Building Energy Dynamics in the U.S.,"* examines examines how climate change–induced cooling demand affects household and building energy use in the United States, focusing on the distributional impacts and policy effectiveness of responses to rising electricity demand and decarbonization pressures.  

My **2025–2026 Job Market Paper**, titled  
*“Heterogeneous Effects of Cooling Demand on Household Electricity Consumption using Causal ML Models,”*  
quantifies the causal and distributional effects of climate-driven cooling demand on household electricity use in the United States using 2020 RECS microdata and advanced causal machine learning estimators (CATE, CQTE, CSQTE).  
This research contributes to energy policy design and climate adaptation strategies by identifying vulnerable households most affected by rising cooling demand.
